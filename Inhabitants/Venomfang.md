# Venomfang
Venomfang was a green dragon who made his lair in an old wizard's tower in the ruins of [[Thundertree]] village.

Venomfang struck a deal with the party to seek out treasure in the Sword Mountains and encouraged them to seek out the [[Zhentarim]]. While entering his tower, the party discovered the name of the mage, Arthindol, who built the tower at [[Old Owl Well]].
