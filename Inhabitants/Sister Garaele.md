# Sister Garaele
Sister Garaele is a young elvin cleric in service to the Temple of Luck to Tymora in [[Phandalin]]. She is a zealous young elf with platinum blond hair to the shoulder. She is the main figure of religion in the town and a devout worshiper of Tymora, the Goddess of Luck.

As a member of the [[Harpers]], she was tasked with confronting the banshee, [[Agatha]], and had to ask her about the location of [[Bowgentle's Book]], a renowned spellbook. However, [[Agatha]] did not appear to the young Harper, and thus she failed in her quest.

Instead of going to confront the banshee again, she planned to find an intermediary to exchange a jeweled comb with [[Agatha]] for the information. Garaele believed only a true flatterer would be able to convince the banshee to give up the information.
