# Agatha
Agatha was a banshee who haunted the Neverwinter Wood near [[Conyberry]]. Agatha was still susceptible to flattery, taking gifts to coerce her vanity, in exchange for knowledge of the surrounding area, which the banshee knew a lot of.

Entreated by [[Sister Garaele]] to seek out the banshee to learn the fate of [[Items/Bowgentle's Book]], the party learned that the banshee once possessed [[Items/Bowgentle's Book]]. Agatha traded the book to a necromancer named [[Tsernoth]] from the city of Iriaebor. She did not know what became of Bowgentle's spellbook after that transaction.
