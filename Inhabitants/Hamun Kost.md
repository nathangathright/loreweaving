# Hamun Kost
Hamun Kost was a Red Wizard of Thay who specialized in necromancy. Kost traveled to [[Old Owl Well]] to search the area for hidden lore of an ancient time. The necromancer set up camp and summoned twelve zombies to protect him during his search.

He sought the name of the mage, Arthindol, who built the tower at [[Old Owl Well]], and encourgaged the party to seek out [[Agatha]] to learn the name.
