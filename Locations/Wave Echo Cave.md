# Wave Echo Cave
Wave Echo Cave was a great cavern complex within the Sword Mountains and the location of the Forge of Spells. The cavern was known for its mineral wealth as well as its magical properties. 

## The Forge of Spells
**Lightbringer**: An enchanted mace that was made for a cleric of Lathander. The brass head of the mace was shaped like a sunburst. The mace was named so because it would glow like a torch at the wielder's command.
**Dragonguard**: Breastplate armor that was created in the shape of a gold dragon. It was created for a human hero of Neverwinter named Tergon.
