# Sword Coast North
The Sword Coast North was a region on the northwestern coast of Faer√ªn. While it comprised a rough landscape of rugged hills, precarious mountain ranges and dense forests, it was home to several like-minded towns and cities. The most prominent of these cities banded together with nearby allies to form the [[Lords' Alliance]] which united much of the region.
